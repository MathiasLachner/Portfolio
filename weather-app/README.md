# Weather App

This is a simple weather application that allows users to check the current weather in any city around the world. The app fetches real-time weather data from the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and displays the temperature, condition, and more.

## What This Project Showcases

This project is designed to showcase:

- **Python Programming Skills**: Using Python to create a simple yet interactive app that interacts with an external API.
- **API Integration**: How to make requests to a third-party API (WeatherAPI) and handle the data returned in a user-friendly format.
- **User Interaction**: A basic user interface that lets users input data (city name) and get relevant responses (weather data).
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: The ability to build a functional, easy-to-use app using Python that doesn't require a graphical interface.
- **Error Handling**: Demonstrates how to handle potential issues like invalid city names, connection problems, or empty responses from the API.


## Features

- **City Search**: Users can input the name of any city.
- **Weather Details**: Displays the current temperature, condition (e.g., sunny, rainy), wind speed, humidity, and more.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive command-line interface for easy use.

## How It Works

1. The user enters a city name.
2. The application sends a request to the WeatherAPI to fetch current weather data for the specified city.
3. The weather information is displayed, including:
   - Temperature
   - Weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy)
   - Wind speed
   - Humidity
